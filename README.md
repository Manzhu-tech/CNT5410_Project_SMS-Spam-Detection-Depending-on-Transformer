# CNT5410_Project_SMS-Spam-Detection-Depending-on-Transformer
A modified version of Transformer model, to detect SMS Spam Messages is used. Additionally, we compare the performance based on accuracy ,loss percentage, recall, and F1-score against traditional Machine learning classifiers, like Long Short-term Memory(LSTM), Bi-Direction LSTM, Na√Øve Bayes, and Dense algorithms. 

Several experiments are performed not only on the popular SMS Spam Collection v.1 dataset, but also on UtkMl's Twitter Spam Detection Competition (UtkMl's Twitter) from Kaggle to make the evaluation more convincing.

SMS Spam Collection: "SMSSpamCollection"
